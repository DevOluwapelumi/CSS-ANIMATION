# CSS-ANIMATION
Just playing with Animation.

CSS Animation is a technique used in web development to create visual effects and movement on web pages using CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). It allows developers to animate HTML elements and apply transitions, transformations, and keyframe animations without the need for JavaScript or other programming languages.

CSS animations provide a way to bring interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages, enhancing the user experience and making the content more engaging. They can be applied to various elements like text, images, buttons, and other HTML elements.

There are three main types of CSS animations:
Transitions: CSS transitions enable smooth changes between two states of an element. You can specify the property to be animated, the duration of the transition, and the timing function (e.g., ease, ease-in, ease-out, linear) that controls the acceleration and deceleration of the animation.
Transformations: CSS transformations allow you to modify the appearance of an element, such as rotating, scaling, skewing, and translating (moving) it in 2D or 3D space. Transformations can be combined with transitions to create more complex animations.
Keyframe Animations: CSS keyframe animations give developers full control over the animation by defining keyframes at specific points in time and specifying the styles the element should have at each keyframe. This provides more flexibility and creativity in crafting complex animations.
